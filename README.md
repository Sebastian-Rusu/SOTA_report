#SOTA Report Implementation
This is an implementation of an evolutionary algorithm in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by organizing and tracking the iterative processes of candidate architecture generation, evaluation, and selection. 
In NAS, evolutionary algorithms operate by evolving a population of neural architectures through genetic operations like mutation and crossover, guided by performance metrics such as accuracy or efficiency. 
The repository acts as a structured platform where code for these operations is implemented, and the architectures' performance results are stored and analyzed.
